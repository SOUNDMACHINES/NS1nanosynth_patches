# Nanosynth-Experiments
a place to store my NS! Nanotynth esperiments as well as the NS1 Fritzing Patch and his paper version

# How to use!

Basic, you really need to have a [NS1 Nanosynth](https://store.arduino.cc/product/E000083) by Soundmachines and a certain number of cables. 

At this point, you can mess around with the manual or take notes yourself about the patches you create printing "NS1 Notebook Sample Page" pdf file.

If you are using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/), you can use the [NS1 Fritzing part](https://github.com/vongomben/Nanosynth-Experiments) in order to let everybody saving their patches.

We've released several new sounds. You can read them hear or hear them on [our sound cloud tracklist](https://soundcloud.com/soundmachines_it/sets/ns1nanosynth-basic-patches-and)
